Usage Notes:

1. First, clone the repository onto your system.
2. Make sure PyTorch is installed and compatible with CUDA (if you have a GPU).
3. The `data.txt` file should contain the text you want to use for training.
4. To train the model, run: `bash train.sh`.
5. After training, you can generate text with: `python mini_gpt.py --sample --prompt "your text"`.
6. The trained model is saved to `mini_gpt.pth` for loading or reuse.
